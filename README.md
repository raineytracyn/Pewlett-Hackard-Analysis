# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
### The purpose of the new analysis determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will be determined by finding the number of retiring employees by Title, and finding the employees eligible for the mentorship program.

## Results:
* You can see there has been a consistent number of employee’s retiring from year to year, with a small increase from the nineites into the two thousands.

* I would highly recommend looking into the profiles listed with the year “9999” to make year corrections. This information could be altering the list of eligible mentors.
###### ![HR_Errors](https://github.com/raineytracyn/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Images/HR_Errors.png)
* Of over 300,000 employees, the company’s requirements reduced the total eligible to mentor to just over 1500 people. Is this enough, and does this provide the correct type of people? If the company is seeking to learn the history, this may not allow for an optimum learning environment.
* On averge, people stay with the company for 5.8 years. During the 80's and 90's, and those born in the 50's and 60's tended to hold onto jobs for 25+ years. This indicates there is a big issues with training and retention.

## Summary:
### How many roles will need to be filled as the massive turn-over begins to make an impact?
#### Less than .5% of the workforce is mentorship eligible. A much greater percentage is retirement eligible. There will most likely be many positions to fill over the next 5+ years. With over 900 people holding 3 roles, there will not be enough people in the workforce to take care of the tasks or even come close to the amount of experience to fill these roles without a gap. I would strongly encourage mapping out what these employees did and assigning the responsibilities to who they can, and see what is left over. What ever work is left over will give an indicator as to how many new people need to be hired. Would also look towards technological advances to lessen the number of people and require over head.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
#### If you were to match human to human, no. However a smarter approach is to assign a few senior people to older mentors, and have the younger crowd be assigned to mentors who have recently retired. This will assist in the lack of numbers, and tailor to the needs of mentees, and what mentors are available to provide. I would also be ideal, to look at mentors who were around the company for a significant period (15 + years). There are 46 people that have over 15 years, and have up to a little over 17 years with the company.
